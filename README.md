### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Python

This repository contains a sample selection of my exercises I made during the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) program with Python.
I used Python to practice more stages of the data analysis process: gathering data, asessing data, cleaning data, doing analysis and 
creating simple diagrams. My most frequent used packages were Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.
